# Testing MDX Components

This is a simple test post to understand how **MDX** works with custom components.

Here's some regular markdown text, and now let's test our custom Highlight component:

<Highlight>This text should be highlighted in yellow!</Highlight>

And let's try different colors:

<Highlight color="blue">Blue highlighted text</Highlight>

<Highlight color="green">Green highlighted text</Highlight>

<Highlight color="red">Red highlighted text for important stuff!</Highlight>

## How cool is this?

Pretty cool! We can mix regular markdown with React components seamlessly.

**Bold text**, *italic text*, and `code snippets` all work as expected.

But we can also add:
- Interactive components
- Custom styling
- Dynamic behavior

This is the power of **MDX** - it's like markdown but supercharged with React! ðŸš€

## Testing Dialogue Components

Now let's test our Dialogue component with the orange quotation marks:

<Dialogue>You are not giving up, Gotham tells me around the 20th move. Good!</Dialogue>

<Dialogue>Now, this is a really bad move.</Dialogue>

<Dialogue>Hey, are we ok?</Dialogue>

You can also use individual glyphs: <GlyphLeft/>Let's spice things up<GlyphRight/> and trigger a flurry of trades.

And mix them with highlights:

<Dialogue>I think you have <Highlight color="red">one move left</Highlight>.</Dialogue>

Pretty cool! The orange quotation marks match the blog's styling perfectly! ðŸŽ¯

## Testing FigureLabel Component

Now let's test image captions with the FigureLabel component using local images:

![Travel Photo](/images/posts/2024/travel-1.jpg)

<FigureLabel>A beautiful travel photo from the original blog collection - stored locally in the project!</FigureLabel>

Let's also test HTML img tags with local images:

<img src="/images/posts/2024/truth.jpg" alt="Truth illustration" style={{maxWidth: '100%', height: 'auto'}} />

<FigureLabel>This "truth" illustration works perfectly with HTML img tags too!</FigureLabel>

And here's a profile image using standard MDX:

![Profile](/images/gianluca-1.jpg)

<FigureLabel>Profile photo from the root images folder - no more weird Gatsby workarounds needed!</FigureLabel>

Perfect! The centered, italicized captions look exactly like the original blog! âœ¨

## Testing TextBox Component

Now let's test highlighted content boxes:

<TextBox title="Important Notice">
This is a highlighted content box with a semi-transparent background and orange left border. Perfect for calling attention to important information!
</TextBox>

<TextBox>
This TextBox has no title, just the content with the signature orange accent styling from the original blog.
</TextBox>

And we can mix TextBox with other components:

<TextBox title="Chess Wisdom">
<Dialogue>You are not giving up, Gotham tells me around the 20th move. Good!</Dialogue>

This shows how <Highlight>multiple components work together</Highlight> within a TextBox!
</TextBox>

Excellent! All components are working perfectly in the new folder structure! ðŸŽ¯
