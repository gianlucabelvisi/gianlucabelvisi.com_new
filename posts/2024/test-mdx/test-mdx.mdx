# Testing MDX Components

This is a simple test post to understand how **MDX** works with custom components.

Here's some regular markdown text, and now let's test our custom Highlight component:

<Highlight>This text should be highlighted in yellow!</Highlight>

And let's try different colors:

<Highlight color="blue">Blue highlighted text</Highlight>

<Highlight color="green">Green highlighted text</Highlight>

<Highlight color="red">Red highlighted text for important stuff!</Highlight>

## How cool is this?

Pretty cool! We can mix regular markdown with React components seamlessly.

**Bold text**, *italic text*, and `code snippets` all work as expected.

But we can also add:
- Interactive components
- Custom styling
- Dynamic behavior

This is the power of **MDX** - it's like markdown but supercharged with React! üöÄ

## Testing Dialogue Components

Now let's test our Dialogue component with the orange quotation marks:

<Dialogue>You are not giving up, Gotham tells me around the 20th move. Good!</Dialogue>

<Dialogue>Now, this is a really bad move.</Dialogue>

<Dialogue>Hey, are we ok?</Dialogue>

You can also use individual glyphs: <GlyphLeft/>Let's spice things up<GlyphRight/> and trigger a flurry of trades.

And mix them with highlights:

<Dialogue>I think you have <Highlight color="red">one move left</Highlight>.</Dialogue>

Pretty cool! The orange quotation marks match the blog's styling perfectly! üéØ

## Testing FigureLabel Component

Now let's test image captions with the FigureLabel component using local images:

![Travel Photo](/images/posts/2024/travel-1.jpg)

<FigureLabel>A beautiful travel photo from the original blog collection - stored locally in the project!</FigureLabel>

Let's also test HTML img tags with local images:

<img src="/images/posts/2024/truth.jpg" alt="Truth illustration" style={{maxWidth: '100%', height: 'auto'}} />

<FigureLabel>This "truth" illustration works perfectly with HTML img tags too!</FigureLabel>

And here's a profile image using standard MDX:

![Profile](/images/gianluca-1.jpg)

<FigureLabel>Profile photo from the root images folder - no more weird Gatsby workarounds needed!</FigureLabel>

Perfect! The centered, italicized captions look exactly like the original blog! ‚ú®

## Testing TextBox Component

Now let's test highlighted content boxes:

<TextBox title="Important Notice">
This is a highlighted content box with a semi-transparent background and orange left border. Perfect for calling attention to important information!
</TextBox>

<TextBox>
This TextBox has no title, just the content with the signature orange accent styling from the original blog.
</TextBox>

And we can mix TextBox with other components:

<TextBox title="Chess Wisdom">
<Dialogue>You are not giving up, Gotham tells me around the 20th move. Good!</Dialogue>

This shows how <Highlight>multiple components work together</Highlight> within a TextBox!
</TextBox>

Excellent! All components are working perfectly in the new folder structure! üéØ

## Testing YouTube Component

Let's test YouTube video embeds:

<YouTube source="dQw4w9WgXcQ" />

<FigureLabel>The classic Rick Roll - perfect for testing YouTube embeds!</FigureLabel>

And we can put YouTube videos inside TextBoxes too:

<TextBox title="Featured Video">
Here's an educational video about React:

<YouTube source="Ke90Tje7VS0" />

<FigureLabel>React in 100 Seconds by Fireship - great for learning!</FigureLabel>
</TextBox>

Perfect! YouTube embeds work beautifully with responsive design! üì∫

## Testing ResponsiveEmbed Component

The ResponsiveEmbed component is more flexible - it can embed ANY iframe with custom aspect ratios:

<ResponsiveEmbed src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ke90Tje7VS0" ratio="16:9" />

<FigureLabel>Using ResponsiveEmbed with 16:9 ratio - same as YouTube component but more flexible!</FigureLabel>

Let's try a different aspect ratio:

<ResponsiveEmbed src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dQw4w9WgXcQ" ratio="4:3" />

<FigureLabel>Same video but with 4:3 ratio - notice the different aspect ratio!</FigureLabel>

And we can embed other services too:

<ResponsiveEmbed 
  src="https://codepen.io/team/codepen/embed/PNaGbb" 
  ratio="2:1" 
  title="CodePen Embed"
/>

<FigureLabel>CodePen embed with a custom 2:1 ratio - ResponsiveEmbed works with any iframe!</FigureLabel>

üéâ **ALL COMPONENTS COMPLETE!** üéâ

## Testing Co-located Images

Now let's test images stored right next to the MDX file (just like in Gatsby):

![Co-located image](travel-1.jpg)

<FigureLabel>This image is stored in the same folder as the MDX file! No more complex path management - just like Gatsby!</FigureLabel>

The system automatically copies co-located images to the public directory and serves them correctly! üìÅ‚ú®

## Testing Poll Component üó≥Ô∏è

Let's test our new interactive Poll component with the same question from the diabetes post:

<Poll
  id="lap_sitting_test"
  question="How did you like sitting on my lap?"
  answers={["It was a once in a lifetime experience!", "It was kinda mid", "I haven't sat on your lap yet"]}
  labels={["Loved it!", "Mid", "DM me"]}
/>

The Poll component features:
- ‚úÖ Interactive voting with Firebase storage
- ‚úÖ Beautiful pie chart results with animated transitions
- ‚úÖ Custom labels vs full answer text
- ‚úÖ Vote counting
- ‚úÖ Orange accent styling matching the blog theme

## Testing Enhanced TextBox (Closeable) üì¶

The TextBox component now supports collapsible content! Let's test it:

### Regular TextBox (unchanged)

<TextBox title="Regular TextBox">
This is a regular TextBox component without closeable functionality - works exactly as before.
</TextBox>

### Closeable TextBox with title

<TextBox title="Definition" closeable={true}>
*From mald +‚Äé -ing, itself a blend of mad +‚Äé bald.*

Malding is a slang word used to describe an angry person. A combo of the words **mad** and **balding**, malding refers to someone (often a gamer) who gets extremely heated about something to the point where they could metaphorically pull out their hair.

This content can be collapsed and expanded using the Hide/Show buttons!
</TextBox>

### Closeable TextBox without title

<TextBox closeable={true}>
This TextBox has no title but is still closeable! You can collapse and expand it using the buttons. Perfect for optional content or detailed explanations that don't clutter the main flow.
</TextBox>

### Closeable TextBox with components inside

<TextBox title="Chess Memory" closeable={true}>

<Dialogue>You are not giving up, Gotham tells me around the 20th move. Good!</Dialogue>

Even when collapsed, this <Highlight>complex content with multiple components</Highlight> maintains its formatting perfectly!

<YouTube source="dQw4w9WgXcQ" />

<FigureLabel>Everything works inside closeable TextBoxes!</FigureLabel>

</TextBox>

## Testing ShakyTitle Component üì¢

The new ShakyTitle component features animated emojis and shaking text for dramatic effect:

<ShakyTitle emoji={"üëÄ"} title={"Important clarification"} />

This is content after a ShakyTitle. Notice the pulsing emoji and the shaking orange text!

<ShakyTitle emoji={"üí©"} title={"Should I test animations?"} />

Another ShakyTitle to make sure the animations work consistently. The animations should run infinitely with smooth CSS transitions.

<ShakyTitle emoji={"üê∂"} title={"Getting ready for doggo post!"} />

Perfect for dramatic section breaks in the upcoming doggo post migration!

## Testing UnicornButton Component ü¶Ñ

The UnicornButton is the most complex component - it features Firebase click tracking with tooltips:

<UnicornButton page={"test"} id={"1"} tooltip={"This is a test tooltip - click to increment!"} />

Try clicking the unicorn above! It should:
- ‚úÖ Show a tooltip on hover
- ‚úÖ Bounce when clicked
- ‚úÖ Increment the counter with Firebase storage
- ‚úÖ Update in real-time across browser sessions

Let's test multiple buttons with different tooltips:

<UnicornButton page={"test"} id={"2"} tooltip={"Second button with different tooltip!"} />

<UnicornButton page={"test"} id={"3"} tooltip={"This one tracks separately from the others"} />

Each button maintains its own click count using Firebase Realtime Database, just like in the original doggo post!

üéâ **ALL COMPONENTS COMPLETE!** üéâ

All components are now ready for the doggo post migration! ShakyTitle provides animated section headers, Poll component provides interactive voting functionality, and TextBox enhancement allows collapsible content sections.
