# Testing MDX Components

This is a simple test post to understand how **MDX** works with custom components.

Here's some regular markdown text, and now let's test our custom Highlight component:

<Highlight>This text should be highlighted in yellow!</Highlight>

And let's try different colors:

<Highlight color="blue">Blue highlighted text</Highlight>

<Highlight color="green">Green highlighted text</Highlight>

<Highlight color="red">Red highlighted text for important stuff!</Highlight>

## How cool is this?

Pretty cool! We can mix regular markdown with React components seamlessly.

**Bold text**, *italic text*, and `code snippets` all work as expected.

But we can also add:
- Interactive components
- Custom styling
- Dynamic behavior

This is the power of **MDX** - it's like markdown but supercharged with React! ðŸš€
