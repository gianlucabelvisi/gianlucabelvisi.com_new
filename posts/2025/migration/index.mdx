## Overview

Migrate the existing Gatsby blog to Next.js while maintaining all functionality and improving the development experience by removing GraphQL, which is cringe.

---

## Phase 1: Proof of Concept (PoC) 🚀

### 1.1 Baby Steps - MDX Understanding ✅

- ✅ Initialize Next.js project in `new_blog/` folder
- ✅ Install MDX dependencies:

  ```bash
  npm install gray-matter next-mdx-remote
  ```

- ✅ Create a simple custom component (e.g., `Highlight` component)
- ✅ Create one test MDX post using the custom component
- ✅ Set up basic dynamic post rendering to understand how MDX works
- ✅ Test: Verify custom component renders correctly in MDX

### 1.2 Real Content Test - Component by Component

**Target Post**: Chess post (`old_blog/src/posts/2024/chess/_chess.mdx`) ✅

**Step 1: Identify Required Components**

- ✅ List all custom components used in the chess post
- ✅ Prioritize by complexity (start with simplest)

**Step 2: Create Components One by One**

- ✅ `Dialogue` component - for quoted speech
- ✅ `GlyphLeft/GlyphRight` components - for orange quotation marks
- ✅ `FigureLabel` component - for image captions
- ✅ ~~`BlogImage` component~~ - **Not needed! Standard MDX + HTML work perfectly**
- ✅ `TextBox` component - for highlighted content boxes
- ✅ `YouTube` component - for embedded videos
- ✅ `ResponsiveEmbed` component - for responsive embeds
- ✅ `Pony` component - for Irish Grover styled text

⚠️ **IMPORTANT REMINDERS**: 

**File Location**: Always create new files in `new_blog/` directory, NOT the root! We're working in the new_blog folder structure.

**Testing Before Completion**: Always ask user to test the post before marking it as complete! Check:
- Cover image alignment (should be `object-position: top`)
- All components working correctly  
- All images loading properly
- Mobile responsiveness
- Interactive elements functional

**MDX Components**: When adding new MDX components, you MUST update TWO files:
1. `lib/mdx-components.tsx` - Add import and export
2. `pages/posts/[...slug].tsx` - Add import and add to components object
Otherwise you'll get "Expected component to be defined" errors!

**Hydration Errors**: Watch out for nested `<p>` tags! MDX automatically wraps content in paragraphs, so components used inline should use `<span>` or `<div>`, NOT `<p>` tags. Common culprits:
- `Dialogue` component - use `<span>` not `<p>`
- Any component that might be used mid-paragraph
- Always test for hydration errors after migrating posts

**Step 3: Test Each Component**

- ✅ Create test MDX files for each component as we build them
- ✅ Verify each component renders correctly before moving to next

**Step 4: Build Proper Blog Post Layout** ✅

- ✅ Create sophisticated blog post template matching Gatsby design:
  - ✅ CSS Grid layout (12-column responsive grid)
  - ✅ Feature image with overlay positioning
  - ✅ Post header with date
  - ✅ Content area with sidebar for social sharing
  - ✅ Proper title/subtitle styling with orange quotation marks
  - ✅ Support for multiple image formats (featureImage, featureImagePhone, cardImage)
  - ✅ Responsive design for mobile
  - ✅ Handle frontmatter: cardImage, featureImage, featureImagePhone, onHover
- ✅ Update PostData interface to include new frontmatter fields
- ✅ Test with existing test post

**Step 5: Copy the Real Post**

- ✅ Copy chess post content to new_blog
- ✅ Import all required components
- ✅ Test full post rendering with proper layout
- ✅ Fix any remaining issues

**Step 6: Enhanced Features**

- ✅ Social sharing sidebar with sticky positioning
- ✅ Firebase reactions system (👍🏽 😂 🥰 😬 🦄)
- ✅ Firebase view counter
- ✅ PostFooter with author and tags
- ✅ MailChimp newsletter signup integration
- ✅ Full-width media support for dramatic content
- ✅ Proper typography spacing (paragraphs, headers)
- ✅ Fixed hydration errors and nested tag issues

### 1.3 Content Discovery System

- ✅ Create `lib/posts.js` with:
  - ✅ `getAllPosts()` function to recursively scan `/posts` directory
  - ✅ Frontmatter parsing with gray-matter
  - ✅ Support for nested directory structures
  - ✅ Post sorting by date (newest first)
  - ✅ Filter hidden and future-dated posts
- ✅ Test with the copied blog post
- ✅ Co-located image support with automatic copying

### 1.4 Dynamic Post Pages

- ✅ Create `pages/posts/[...slug].js` for dynamic routing
- ✅ Implement `getStaticPaths()` to generate all post routes
- ✅ Implement `getStaticProps()` to fetch individual post data
- ✅ Basic post rendering with `next-mdx-remote`
- ✅ Test with nested URL paths (e.g., `/posts/2024/my-post`)

### 1.5 Homepage with Post Listing

- ✅ Create basic homepage (`pages/index.js`)
- ✅ Use `getStaticProps()` to fetch all posts
- ✅ Simple post list layout (title, date, excerpt)
- ✅ Verify automatic post discovery works
- ✅ Test: Add new MDX file and confirm it appears automatically

### 1.6 Basic Styling Setup

- ✅ Install and configure styled-components
- ✅ Create basic global styles
- ✅ Simple responsive layout structure

**PoC Success Criteria:**
✅ Drop an MDX file in `/posts` → automatically appears on homepage  
✅ Click post → navigate to full post page  
✅ MDX content renders correctly  
✅ Nested directory structure supported

## Phase 2: Core Features Migration and Additions 🏗️

- ✅ Copy all posts from `old_blog/src/posts/` to `new_blog/posts/`
- ✅ Verify all frontmatter is parsed correctly
- ✅ Handle any content format inconsistencies
- ✅ Test post discovery with full content library
- [ ] Some pages, like impostor-syndrome and the last caterina sforza, have 2 mdx in the folder. This is fucking up the way you generate the pages, leading to debt like @impostor-syndrome.tsx and @overcoming-impostor-syndrome.tsx. We need to remove this hack by splitting the posts containing two mdx into two. So we have two folders each containing a post and the images related to it
    - [ ] Let's start with impostor syndrome
    - [ ] Once confirmed it works, let's do caterina

### 2.2 TODO
- [ ]



### 2.4 Advanced Post Features

### 3.2 Homepage Sliders (Netflix-style)

- [ ] Create `NetflixSlider` component
- [ ] Implement post grouping logic:
  - [ ] Latest posts

  - [ ] Random posts
  - [ ] Chronological order
- [ ] Featured post component for hero section
- [ ] Responsive slider with touch/swipe support

### 2.4 Image Optimization

- [ ] Migrate images from `old_blog/src/assets/images/`

- [ ] Custom domain configuration
- [ ] Performance testing

---

## Phase 6: Content Migration & Testing 🧪

### 6.1 Content Audit

- [ ] Check all images and media files
- [ ] Test all internal links
- [ ] Validate frontmatter consistency

### 6.2 Feature Parity Testing
